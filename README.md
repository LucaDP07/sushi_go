**Web Marketing Strategy**
- - -

- Email Marketing: MailChimp Newsletter 
In order to increase engagement with the site and build a stronger relationship with its customers, the Sushi Go Team partnered with MailChimp. This is a free service to collect customers email addresses and share news, services and special offers with customers and potential customers. The feature is located on the Footer, visible in every page. The customers have the opportunity to enter their address to subscribe and get a success message once the subscription is completed. No registration to the Sushi Go website is required to benefit of this service.
Below is a screenshot of the Sushi Go - Mailchimp dashboard.

- Social Media Marketing: Facebook Page
In order to increase traffic to the website, the Sushi Go Team has created a Facebook Business Page for organic social media marketing. The decision was taken considering the impact of the social media platform on the Irish people. We can see that in 2023 3.51 millions of irish out of 5.1 is using Facebook, and for this reason it's still considered a great option to promote the business online.

- Search Engine Optimization(SEO)
The meta keywords and description in the site's base.html have been chosen after a keywords research conducted through Ubersuggest by Neil Patel, a SEO and content marketing tool.
For SEO purposes, a sitemap.xml and robots.txt file were included to the website's root directory to improve the quality of the website and to ensure that search engines are able to understand its structure.

**Structure**

The users will first see the Home Page, where they can find a call to action button to start exploring the menu. A navbar is also available and give access to all the necessary info.

Both registered and unregistered users can place their own order and complete the checkout process, but only registered users can interact with the page by creating their personal wish list, leaving a feedback or updating their own profile details.

Simply by clicking on "View details" more information about the dish will be revealed and a "Add to basket" button will also be available.

The "Wish list" page is accessible only for registered users. This page can be accessed by clicking the 'Wish list' button in the navigation bar, which is only visible for a registered user. After completing the log in, the user will see a "Add to wish list" button on the menu page, right under the "View details" button and the picture of the dish. Users are then able to edit their own wish list as they like.

**TESTING**
- - - 
Manual testing was carried out to ensure the site works as intended.

All the pages of the website have ben tested using the developer tools in Google Chrome. The code had to be changed along the process in order to achieve the responsiveness required for the project. The preview from Gitpod helped to constantly check all the changes made.

Testing was performed using a MacBook Air (M1, 2020) on macOS Monterey with the following browsers:
- Google Chrome 102.0.5005.61
- Safari 15.3
- Mozilla Firefox 101.0.1

After testing the website I can confirm the project it's responsive in its all pages and works properly on all standard screen sizes.

The forms are working in each section of the project.
- The users can add, edit and delete their own posts.
- Comments can be added through the comment form. To be displayed need to be approved by the owner of the website.

**DEPLOYMENT**
- - -
The site was deployed via Heroku. These are the steps I followed:

- In the Heroku dashboard, click "New" and then "Create new app". After that enter the app name and specify the region.

- In the Heroku dashboard click on the Resources tab
Scroll down to Add-Ons, search for and select 'Heroku Postgres'.

- In the setting tab, click on Reveal Config Vars button then copy the value for DATABASE_URL key.

- In Gitpod create a new env.py file and import the os library. Heroku Config vars need to be set accordingly including DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY.

- In the settings.py file within the django app, import Path from pathlib, import os and import dj_database_url
- Insert the line if os.path.isfile("env.py"): import env
- Remove the insecure secret key that django has in the settings file by default and replace it with SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
- Replace the databases section with DATABASES = { 'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}
- In the Gitpod terminal, migrate the change by python3 manage.py migrate.
- Login to Cloudinary and copy the API Environment variable and paste in env.py and also Config Vars in Heroku.
- In Heroku config vars add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC with value of '1' (this must be removed for final deployment)
- Add Cloudinary libraries to installed apps section of settings.py as per follow:

- - Add 'cloudinary_storage', before 'django.contrib.staticfiles', and 'cloudinary' right after it.

- In the Settings.py file - add the STATIC files settings - the url, storage path, directory path, root path, media url and default file storage path.

- Set TEMPLATES_DIR just below BASE_DIR and insert TEMPLATES_DIR in TEMPLATES array 'DIRS': []

- Set ALLOWED_HOSTS as 'traveldream.herokuapp.com', 'localhost'

- Create Procfile and add the code: web gunicorn traveldream.wsgi
- On GitHub add, commit and push the changed files.
- On Heroku click on the Deploy tab, connect to GitHub and search for the repository then Connect
- Click on Deploy Branch.
- Once the development process is complete, change the debug setting to: DEBUG = False in settings.py.
- Considering for this project the summernote editor was used in Heroku add: X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'SAMEORIGIN' to settings.py.
- In Heroku settings config vars change the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC value to 0.
- Click on Deploy Branch. When the app is deployed a message 'Your app was successfully deployed' will be shown. Click 'view' to see the deployed app in the browser.

During my work to the project, I had to migrate my database from Heroku to ElephantSQL. Here are the stpes I've taken:

- Create and account with ElephantSQL.
- Create New Instance, specify the region, select a data center near my location, click review and click "Create Instance"
- In the ElephantSQL dashboard click on the database instance name for this project(traveldream).
- In the URL section copy the database URL.
- In the env.py file replace the DATABASE_URL variable with the the relevant string from ElephantSQ.
- Run the migration command in the terminal to migrate the database structure to the newly-connected ElephantSQL database.
